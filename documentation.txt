NOTE: this was made in the PyCharm IDE and Python 3.9. Not sure how best this would work with Jupyter or another IDE
Make sure you import pyspark, xarray (if necessary)
In PyCharm go to File > Settings > Project name > Python Interpreter > + button > search up those package names and install them

Objective of current main.py:
step #1 - output the nc file to csv
step #2 - import csv module we created earlier
step #3 - start a spark session from pyspark.sql module

use either the provided 'output.csv' or 'small output.csv' (recommended) to test the main.py file

to do list:
- should we experiment with removing certain columns, combining multiple nc files? or is this "good to go"?
- experiment with more transforms (i.e. calculate average, etc)
- calculate time
- if necessary: change up number of partitions, datasize, etc
